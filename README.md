# dotfiles

repo for storing my arch linux dotfiles

after initial install and network configuration get all programs with

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fergus-Molloy/dotfiles/master/bin/download_programs | bash
```

Once everything installed you *should* be good to download all the dotfiles using `yadm https://github.com/Fergus-Molloy/dotfiles.git` (it will overwrite any duplicate files)
