# dotfiles

repo for storing my arch linux dotfiles

once pikaur is installed run `cat .programs | xargs pikaur -S` to setup basic programs then install all the config files

remember to let light be executed without sudo otherwise brightness keys will break

everything is themed around [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) so install that too
